      "In this lab, you will learn some of the statistical values and methods that physicists use to describe exactly how certain they are in their measurement or calculation. After this lab, you should be able to define and calculate average, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, and Z-score. You should also be able to use the GraphingTools spreadsheet to fit data with a line and extract the slope and offset from that fit. We will use these skills throughout the rest of the term.\n",
      "Please show your work for all calculations.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Inherent to physics is the quantitative observation of physical phenomena, i.e. measurements. For example, one can measure the universal gravitational constant or the mass of an electron. How precisely we can determine some of these quantities has far-reaching consequences. \n",
      "Many physical quantities are predicted to have specific values. However, the value we measure might differ from that value. For a physicist, reporting the value measured is only half the job. Essential to any measurement is determining or estimating the precision of the measurement. Experimentally measured quantities should always be accompanied by uncertainties, which indicate that experiments can never determine exactly the true value of the quantity.  The best they can do is describe the range where the true value likely is.\n",
      "(In simulations, of course, uncertainty can be added or suppressed at will.  For example, the PhET simulations are always exact except for rounding errors; the Polyhedron simulations include simulated statistical variability. In the real world, uncertainty is always present.  This worksheet provides an essential perspective on real measurements.)\n",
      "In a typical undergraduate laboratory, we will almost always be measuring a quantity that has been measured before and is well known to many decimal places – such as the acceleration of earth’s gravity g.  Students may think they will be judged by how close they are to the known value. However, it is a mistake to assume that the measurement one makes is (or must be) exact.  Equipment or ambient conditions may conspire to make precise readings impossible!  Instead, seek to realistically describe and report the precision of the experimental apparatus and procedures.  One of the purposes of this lab is to introduce students to the concept of uncertainty and to some of the basic strategies for interpreting uncertainties.\n",
      "Background: Statistical and Systematic Uncertainties\n",
      "There are two types of uncertainty, and they are fundamentally different. The first kind is statistical uncertainty, and it relates to random variations.  For example, the number of fish in a pond may fluctuate randomly year to year even if nothing about the pond or the fish changes. The second kind is systematic uncertainty, which relates to some unknown cause-and-effect phenomenon that impacts the way a measurement turns out. For example, the number of fish in a pond may fluctuate year to year depending on the weather (which impacts the food supply) even if nothing about the pond or the fish appears to change.\n",
      "In general, statistical uncertainty manifests as randomness and systematic uncertainty manifests as patterns.  Systematic uncertainty can be reduced by carefully checking the setup and tools to make sure everything is properly calibrated, and all conditions are accounted for.  Statistical uncertainty can be reduced only by taking more data and averaging to compensate for the randomness. For small data sets, it can be hard to distinguish which is the primary source of uncertainty. A skilled experimentalist is one who knows which type to investigate first.\n",
      "Illustration: A poll shows that 49% of voters surveyed plan to vote for Candidate A, while 42% plan to vote for Candidate B (9% undecided). A subsequent poll by a different pollster shows a 48-44 split; the headlines claim that the race has narrowed. However, the change could easily be due to a different set of individuals being surveyed (statistical uncertainty) or the different wording of the poll questions (systematic uncertainty).\n",
      "This worksheet will primarily focus on statistical uncertainty.\n",
      "Statistical Uncertainty: Average and Standard Deviation\n",
      "A “fair” six-sided die is one which has an equal probability to land on any of its six sides.  This means that the die has a 1/6 = 16.7% chance of rolling each of its six numbers.  Rolling a die is a random process, so it is meaningless to predict that a given roll will give you a specific number.  Each roll is completely random and independent of all previous or future rolls.\n",
      "1.1 (5 points)  Suppose you roll the die five times.  In order, the results of your rolls are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  What is the chance that your next roll will be a 6?\n",
      "16.7%16.7%\n",
      "We would like some tools to make useful predictions about any given roll.  The first of these tools is the average.  Imagine rolling your die many times and summing up the values, then dividing the total by the number of rolls you made.  Effectively, you are considering each trial to have contributed an equal share toward the total.  This contribution is the average  (“ex-bar”):\n",

      "For most situations, the only way to find the average of a random process is to actually carry out an experiment to measure it.  Luckily for the sake of this example, dice are one of the few cases where an average can be mathematically derived ahead of time.  For a fair six-sided die, all six outcomes are equally likely, so we can just look at the sum of all outcomes and divide by six: .  Thus, the average roll is a three-and-a-half.\n",
      "Of course, in practice any given roll probably doesn’t contribute this equal amount.  It’s literally impossible to roll a three-and-a-half on six-sided die!  The standard deviation σ describes the uncertainty about how close any single trial will be to the average value. Any given trial has a 68% chance of being within one standard deviation above or below the mean value .  Thus, there is a significant chance that the deviation in single trial will be even greater than one standard deviation.  The formula for standard deviation is\n",

Empirically, we would keep one significant figure for the reported uncertainty if the first non-zero digit is 2 or larger. Then you should round the reported value to the same decimal place as the uncertainty. Common practice, however, sanctions one exception to this rule. If the first significant digit in the uncertainty is a one, then keeping two digits in the uncertainty is frequently justified. I will give two examples for each case below: \n",

      "In physics lab, we will often be comparing two values to see if they are consistent with each other. Roughly, if the difference between the two values is much bigger than their uncertainties, we say that they are inconsistent, but if the difference is smaller than their uncertainties, we say that they are consistent. We formalize this by calculating a Z-score, as\n",

      "where  and  are the two values that you are comparing and  and  are the uncertainties in each value. Often, one of the two values is known exactly, so its uncertainty is zero and the denominator gets much simpler.\n",
      "A Z-score close to zero means that the outcome  is likely.  Large  means the outcome is very unlikely, and we need to worry whether it was due to a fluke of luck or whether there is something fundamental that we are misunderstanding.  The exact threshold depends on the details of the experiment, but in this lab course, we will define a small Z-score to be less than or equal to 2.\n",
      "2.1 (5 points)  The standard deviation describes how far any single trial will probably be from the experimental average . Put another way, it is a good estimate of the uncertainty in a single measurement. On my turn playing Monopoly, I roll a 10.  Based on your calculated  and  from your table, what is the Z-score of 10?

      "Standard error of the mean\n",
      "The standard deviation describes how far any single trial will likely be from the experimental average .  Often, we are more interested in a different question: how precise is our measured average ?  This often occurs when we have some sort of predictive model we are trying to test.  The model tells us , the value we predict the average to be.  If our measured average  is different, then we need to decide if the difference can be explained away by statistical uncertainty (“we had bad luck and all 10 of our measured rolls from our table happened to be low, so our measured average is lower than predicted”) or if our model is fundamentally flawed.\n",

This is the main way of overcoming statistical uncertainty.  The uncertainty about the average will always be smaller than the uncertainty about a single measurement, and it can be reduced by taking more data.  (The standard deviation does not shrink with additional measurements.)\n",
      "3.1 (10 points) Because these are dice, we can calculate that a Monopoly player will on average move  squares per turn.  (A single die ought to roll a 3.5 on average, so two dice ought to roll  on average.)  Is your observed average from question 1.3 consistent with this predicted average?

      "Note that just because your Z-score is close to zero does not guarantee that your experiment is meaningful.  If  is large, then a huge range of possible observations are all consistent with your expectations.  Because your data is so uncertain, it tells you very little information.  In such a case, you should take more measurements to increase , decrease  , and make your results more meaningful.\n",
      "In this example of rolling dice, the randomness is expected.  Dice are meant to be random in a way that scientific measurements aren’t.  But in fact, almost every measurement is expected to have some amount of statistical (random) uncertainty.  These same tools (average, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, Z-score) will apply.\n",
      "Linear Fitting\n",
      "So far, we have been discussing measuring the same thing many times, but we often want to study what happens when we change something between measurements. Fitting lets us extract information from a set of different measurements, rather than from many identical measurements.   As we vary some condition, we try to match the observed trend to a formula predicted by our model.  This sort of procedure will also be affected by uncertainties.\n",
      "This worksheet does not have the space to delve into the details of how fitting programs work.  But as a brief overview, the idea is to use a mathematical algorithm to find the constants (here, slope and intercept) which make the line most closely match the data.  Different algorithms use different definitions of “most closely match” and different strategies for finding these constants.  We will be using Excel’s function “LINEST”, which uses the “least squares” algorithm.  Essentially, it tries to reduce the sum of the  values from table 2.1, except that it looks at the difference between the data and the fitted line instead between the data and the data’s average.\n",
      "In this section we will work through an example of linear fitting to understand what uncertainty in a fit parameter means.  We will continue our Monopoly example to ultimately extract the average movement per turn by fitting a line to our data.\n",
      "4.1 (10 points)  For each of the “number of turns” listed in the table below, find the total distance the player has moved by rolling twice that many dice (each turn’s movement is two dice.)  Record the total in the table.  Once again, you can roll real physical dice or use an online dice-roller such as https://www.random.org/dice/.  Or just type “roll Nd6” into Google to roll N six-sided dice.\n",
      "Note: Each number you include in the table below should assume that the player re-started their movement for that number of turns – don’t add to the previous row. As an example, when you roll 2 dice for the first row, you might roll a 12, but when you roll 4 dice for the second row, you might only roll a total of 7. The rolls will probably not match your intuition for what rolling that many dice “should” produce, but this is normal.  We are testing a random process, so we expect to see some variation.\n",
